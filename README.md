1. The CRY of the INNOCENT for JUSTICE.
I Have here collected the Proceedings of the now preſent Chief Juſtice of the King's Bench, with oth
    _ On the ſixt day of the week in the forenoon following, the Court being ſate, John Crook was called to the Bar.

    _ Now followeth thoſe two points of Law and Conſcience, which J. C. deſired of the Court, that he might be heard to ſpeak to them as God ſhould give him utterance at that time, expecting they would have given him liberty until the next Seſſions, and therefore had no thoughts of ſpeaking to theſe things when he was called to the Bar; but the Court denyed him liberty, yet he began to ſpeak as followeth, but was interrupted.

    _ Now followeth the point of Conſcience that I deſired to be heard to ſpeak to.

    _ Some ANIMADVERSIONS upon the whole Matter, ſhewing the Severity and Unmercifulneſs (if not cruel Injuſtice) of the late Proceedings againſt us; Leaving it to be judged by God's Witneſs in every Conſcience.
